# Slideshow Testing
## Instructions
- Upload images from your collection and try out how they look in a slideshow
- The slideshow is activated, i.e. you can try it after at least two entered images
- If you try to upload the same image more than once, it is ignored
- You can adjust the width and height of the frame in which images appear during a slide show
